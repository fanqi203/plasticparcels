# Summary
-- to update, this is just what we used in the OSM24 abstract
Lagrangian ocean analysis, where virtual particles are tracked in hydrodynamic flow fields, is widely used to uncover and investigate the pathways and timescales of the dispersion of plastic particulates in the ocean. However, plastics of different properties (e.g., size, shape, density) behave differently due to the complex fine-scale physics at play. This has led to a proliferation of community-developed software packages that are specific to particular plastic classes, or ocean models, and are inflexible and difficult to integrate into different applications. PlasticParcels is a python tool for simulating the dispersion of plastics in the global ocean. The tool is based on the Parcels computational Lagrangian framework, providing a modular and customizable python notebook for advecting virtual plastic particles with a wide range of properties, applying a collection of physical processes such as Stokes drift, wind-induced drift, biofouling, and turbulent mixing. The current version supports nano- and microplastic behavior, with support for macroplastics planned in the near-future.  It has been designed for use on the Copernicus Marine Service platform, providing new plastic modelling capabilities as part of the NECCTON project.
